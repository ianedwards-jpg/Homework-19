# Heroku-React-Table-App
 
## Overview

Heroku JSON Table Application is a dynamic table used to display JSON data in a table that can be sorted alphabetically, by phone number, by Employee ID or any other field.

## Views


Heroku JSON Table Application is a single page table that will allow you to view and sort JSON data in ascending or decending order per each field.

![Main Page](https://github.com/ianedwards-jpg/Heroku-React-Table-App/blob/master/react-table-heroku/client/public/react_table.jpg)

Users can sort the table by

* User ID 

* Job Title

* First Name 

* Last Name 

* Preferred Name 

* Employee Code 

* Employee Region 

* Phone Number 

* Email 

## Usage 

If you wish to view your own JSON via this application, you will need to update the URL within the Ajax call, as well as the "req" fields to match the data you are trying to map. You will also have manually modify the column titles to fit your JSON. 

## Future Development

In the future, I wish to modify the GUI so that a URL can be inserted and JSON added to the table via an on-screen URL bar.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
